Here's a simple bash script to install Homebrew on WSL:

1. Create a file called `install_brew.sh`.
2. Paste the following content into it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Add Homebrew to the shell environment
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.profile
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# Check Homebrew version
brew --version
```

3. Save the file and give it execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x install_brew.sh
```

4. Run the script:

```bash
./install_brew.sh
```

This script will install Homebrew and configure it for use in WSL.

# Install Homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.profile
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
source ~/.profile
