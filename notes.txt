Title:
Stress Test on Redis Cluster Capability

Problem Statement:
Following the failed Studio K8S testing, the Redis cluster encountered issues, returning the error: xxx. A stress test needs to be performed to evaluate the cluster’s performance under load and identify potential configuration issues.

Work Involved:

	•	Analyze the current Redis cluster configuration.
	•	Perform a stress test on the Redis cluster to reproduce and examine the error.
	•	Identify any performance bottlenecks or misconfigurations.
	•	Recommend optimizations to improve cluster stability and performance.

Test Criteria:

	•	Redis cluster should perform reliably under stress without errors.
	•	Bottlenecks and misconfigurations are identified and resolved.

Dependencies:

	•	Access to the Redis cluster.
	•	Coordination with the testing team to simulate load.

Acceptance Criteria:

	•	Redis cluster passes the stress test without errors.
	•	Necessary optimizations are documented and applied as needed.

This Jira-friendly format is concise and follows the standard structure for problem statements, tasks, test criteria, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.
