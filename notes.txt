Title: Increase Memory for ProductApi App and Verify Cluster Capacity

Problem Statement:
Due to recent testing failures, we need to increase the memory for the ProductApi app and check the cluster’s capacity to ensure it can handle the extra load.

Work Involved:

	•	Assess current memory usage.
	•	Check cluster capacity to ensure space for the additional memory.
	•	Increase memory allocation for ProductApi.
	•	Test the app for stability after the changes.

Test Criteria:

	•	ProductApi runs without memory issues.
	•	Cluster has sufficient capacity.
	•	Successful deployment and test results.

Dependencies:

	•	Access to Kubernetes monitoring tools for capacity checks.
	•	Coordination with the testing team.

Acceptance Criteria:

	•	Memory is increased and stable.
	•	Cluster has sufficient space for the added memory.

This version is concise and direct, focusing on key tasks and criteria.
