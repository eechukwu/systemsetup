Sure! Hereâ€™s the plan with the specific web pages for the Helm charts we are checking.

Web Pages We Are Using (Examples):
Argo CD Helm chart page:

URL: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/argo/argo-cd

Argo Events Helm chart page:

URL: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/argo/argo-events

Argo Workflows Helm chart page:

URL: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/argo/argo-workflows

External Secrets Helm chart page:

URL: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/external-secrets-operator/external-secrets

Here's How It Will Work:
The script will fetch the HTML content of each URL.

It will then look for the version number within the HTML content. The version is typically mentioned in the page title or somewhere visible on the page.

The script will output the name of each Helm chart and its latest version in a clean, readable table format.
