Judging from the logs, I don’t think this server is currently being used.

Below are my findings:
	•	The log files contain three folders: A, B, and C.
	•	Folders A and B are currently empty and contain no files.
	•	Folder C contains some files, but none appear to be app-specific logs.
	•	All the logs contain similar information.

I will be reaching out to the Warehouse and Retail teams to confirm the above before disabling the app.
